From solutions `Approach 2: Bidirectional Breadth First Search` fails test case:

beginWord = "hbo" <br/>
endWord = "qbx" <br/>
wordList = ["abo","hco","hbw","ado","abq","hcd","hcj","hww","qbq","qby","qbz","qbx","qbw"] <br/>

The output is 5, but the expected value is 4 ("hbo" -> "hbw" -> "qbw" -> "qbx").

There seems to be an order component missing in the solution because if I reshuffle the wordList to a 
more favorable combination such as `["hbw","qbx","qbw", "abo","hco","ado","abq","hcd","hcj","hww","qbq","qby","qbz"]` it 
returns the expected value of 4.
