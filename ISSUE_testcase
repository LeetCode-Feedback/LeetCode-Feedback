# 1697. Checking Existence of Edge Length Limited Paths
The first sample example of this question:
Input: n = 3, edgeList = [[0,1,2],[1,2,4],[2,0,8],[1,0,16]], queries = [[0,1,2],[0,2,5]]
Output: [false,true]
Explanation: The above figure shows the given graph. Note that there are two overlapping edges between 0 and 1 with distances 2 and 16.
For the first query, between 0 and 1 there is no path where each distance is less than 2, thus we return false for this query.
For the second query, there is a path (0 -> 1 -> 2) of two edges with distances less than 5, thus we return true for this query.

The second output in the boolean array should be  "FALSE" because according to the question the cumulative value of the shortest path is coming greater than 5.
This is not in compliance to the question. According to the question the path should be less than the limit which is given 5 for this edge and the smallest path is 6.
Kindly look upon this issue.
